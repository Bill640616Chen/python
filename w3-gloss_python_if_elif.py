#If Elif
#The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
#elif關鍵字是pythons的方式說 「如果以前的條件不是真的， 那麼嘗試這個條件」 。
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
#In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".
#在這個例子中，a等於b，所以第一個條件不是真的，但elif條件是真實的，所以我們列印到篩選"a 和 b 是相等的"。
