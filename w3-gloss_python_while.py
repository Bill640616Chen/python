#The while Loop while迴圈
#With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
#在迴圈中，只要條件屬實，我們就可以執行一組語句。
#Print i as long as i is less than 6:
#列印 i 只要小於 6：
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
#Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
#注意：記住要增量 i，否則迴圈將永久持續。
#The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
#雖然迴圈需要相關的變數準備好，在此示例中，我們需要定義一個索引變數，i，我們將其設置為 1。
