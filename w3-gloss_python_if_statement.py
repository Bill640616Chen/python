#If Statement
#Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
#Python 支援數學中通常的邏輯條件：
#Equals: a == b
#Not Equals: a != b
#Less than: a < b
#Less than or equal to: a <= b
#Greater than: a > b
#Greater than or equal to: a >= b
#These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
#這些條件可以通過多種方式使用，最常見的是「如果語句」和迴圈。
#An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
#使用如果關鍵字編寫「如果陳述」。
#If statement:
#如果聲明：
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
#In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".
#在這裡示例中，我們使用兩個變數，a和b，這些變數用作如果語句的一部分來測試b是否大於a。作為一個是33，b是200，我們知道200大於33，所以我們列印螢幕，"b大於a"。
