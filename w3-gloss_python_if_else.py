#If Else
#The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
#其他關鍵字捕獲任何沒有被上述條件捕獲的東西。
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
print('-------------分隔線------------')
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
elif a > b:
  print("a is greater than b")
#In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
#在這個例子中，一個大於b，所以第一個條件不是真的，elif條件是不真實的，所以我們去其他條件和列印螢幕，"a大於b"。
#You can also have an else without the elif:
#您也可以有一個沒有：else elif
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")
