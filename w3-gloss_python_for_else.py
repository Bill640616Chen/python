#The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:
#循環中的關鍵字指定了在迴圈完成時要執行的代碼塊：else for
#Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:
#列印從 0 到 5 的所有數位，並在循環結束時列印訊息：
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
