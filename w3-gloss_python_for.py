#For Loops For迴圈
#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
#for迴圈用於在序列中重述（即清單、圖、字典、集或字串）。
#This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
#這不像其他程式設計語言中的關鍵字，並且工作方式更像其他對象導向程式設計語言中的傳譯器方法。
#With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
#for迴圈，我們可以執行一組語句，一次針對清單中的每個專案、圖普、集等。
#Print each fruit in a fruit list:
#將每個水果列印在水果清單中：
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
#The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
#for迴圈不需要事先設置索引變數。
